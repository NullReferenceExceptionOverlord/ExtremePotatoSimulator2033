## Mega top secret algoritm
Our bot should hold on to his strong cards till the deck is empty(When our bot has first card turn).
Reminders

- check to see if we can switch thrump card with Donald Thrump.
- Keep memory of all played cards and make predictions based upon that (close the game or not)

Exeptions (goes in the logic -> Oponent player throws first card):

1. Oponent player throws a high card (A,10) and we have thrump card to "cakame".
2. Oponent player plays a weak card and we have a high card of the same "boq"(I really should learn the stupid words).
3. Take oponents card if we have a stronger one of the same eh "boq"...

Empty deck logic(same as closed game)

1. Look in the remaining cards and determine which cards in our hand will win (ex. we have ace of spades, all but 10 of spades is played -> oponent has 10 of spades = we win the hand)
2. When all the winning cards are played determine if We have a stronger thrump card then the oponent if(yes) - > play them.
