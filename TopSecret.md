## Mega top secret algoritm
Our bot should hold on to his strong cards till the deck is empty(When our bot has first card turn).
Reminders

- check to see if we can switch thrump card with Donald Thrump.
- Keep memory of all played cards and make predictions based upon that (close the game or not)

Exeptions (goes in the logic -> Oponent player throws first card):

1. Oponent player throws a high card (A,10) and we have thrump card to "cakame".
2. Oponent player plays a weak card and we have a high card of the same "boq"(I really should learn the stupid words).
